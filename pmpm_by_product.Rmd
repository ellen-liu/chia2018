```{r load packages}
# you'll need to use the library() command to load any packages that you'll use in your R session.
# library(Hmisc)   # for describing variables 
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(car)     # for anovas
library(readr)
library(RColorBrewer) 
```
If a package doesn't load from the library command it's likely not been installed yet. Go to your tool bar at the top of your screen and install the package with the same name.

  If a variable is a factor, it can be labelled above with its question content, but it's levels need to be labeled as well using syntax below. You can also view the excel file 00.1_Labelling helper.xlsx to expedite this process.
