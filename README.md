## Data Interpretation through Python and R
This project is part of a short-term internship (January 8 - 19, 2018) done at the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) in Boston, MA. Using publicly available data (http://www.chiamass.gov/annual-report), I use Python and R to interpret and manage healthcare coverage and cost data.
